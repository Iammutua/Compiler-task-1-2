### Task 1

#### Logic used

The Python script reads a C++ file line by line and identifies comments within the code. The comments can be single-line comments starting with `//` or multi-line comments enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

#### Function to Check if a Line is a Comment

```python
def is_comment(line):
    if line.strip().startswith("//"):
        return True
    return re.match(r'/\*.*\*/', line.strip()) is not None
```

#### Importance of Lexical and Syntax Analysis Concepts

In the logic used to identify comments in a C++ file, both lexical analysis and syntax analysis concepts are important. Here's how they play a role:

##### Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis involves the process of breaking the input code into meaningful elements, also known as tokens. In our case, identifying comments as tokens is essential for recognizing them within the code. The function `is_comment` utilizes lexical analysis concepts by using regular expressions to identify patterns that represent comments. The regular expressions help in tokenizing the code and identifying comments based on patterns like `//` or `/* */`.

##### Syntax Analysis

Syntax analysis is the process of analyzing the structure of a program to determine its syntactic correctness. Although the provided logic primarily focuses on identifying comments based on lexical analysis, the concept of syntax analysis indirectly comes into play. Recognizing comments accurately is crucial for proper syntax analysis of the code. Incorrectly identifying comments could potentially lead to errors or misinterpretations during subsequent phases of the compilation process. Therefore, ensuring correct comment identification is vital for maintaining the syntactic integrity of the C++ code.

In summary, while lexical analysis is directly used to tokenize and identify comment patterns, the correct identification of comments significantly impacts the syntax analysis phase, indirectly emphasizing its importance in the overall logic.
